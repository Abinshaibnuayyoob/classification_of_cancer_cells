# Breast Cancer Cell Detection

This project aims to classify breast cancer cells as malignant or benign using various machine learning techniques.

## Overview

- **Objective**: To accurately detect whether breast cancer cells are malignant or benign.
- **Techniques Used**: SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Means.
- **Dataset**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (available from UCI Machine Learning Repository).

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Extensive data cleaning and feature selection.
- **Model Training**: Applied multiple machine learning algorithms to classify the cells.
- **Feature Detection**: Utilized K-Means clustering to detect and differentiate feature values between malignant and benign cells.
- **Results**: Achieved high classification accuracies, with SVM performing the best at 97%.
